## What I learnt

I learned a lot about color, specifically how to avoid making people
look yellow. I did some research and ultimately decided on a mix of
L152 Pale Gold and L201 Full C.T. Blue. This combination worked
effectively for some actors, but many still ended up looking yellow.
In a subsequent show, I tried L003 Pale Lavender and found that it
works quite well for most actors.
